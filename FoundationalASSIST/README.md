**Access requests will be faster if you have a university or research-affiliated email associated with your Hugging Face account**

**Unfortunate news:** Please note that this project is primarily supported by federal grants from the US government. As such, we need to follow certain regulations. Sadly, one is that we cannot share data with researchers from countries designated as ["Countries of concern"](https://www.state.gov/countries-of-particular-concern-special-watch-list-countries-entities-of-particular-concern). We hope to soon share this dataset with the many fabulous researchers from these countries, but as of today, we are not legally permitted to do so.

**IMPORTANT UPDATE ON 3/19:** Due to an issue with git LFS 700k rows in interactions.csv were missing. Please redownload the dataset to use these rows.

**Note:** Access requests are reviewed Monday. You may need to verify your email or use case, plesae monitor your email.

# Overview of Foundational ASSIST
Foundational ASSIST is a dataset containing all natural text of problems and student answers as recorded by ASSISTments. The problems are from  from Illustrative Mathematics 6th - 8th grade math curriculum, a common core aligned curriculum popular in the United States. 

The data is in the "Data" folder. The code used to generate results in the original paper by Worden et al. is in the Code folder, and the results (in case you do not wish to reinference) are in the "Results" folder.

The dataset is comprised of three files: 
1. **Interactions**, which contains students attempts of problems, 
2. **Problems**, which includes information relevant to problems, and 
3. **Skills**, which links Problems to skills. 
The dataset was curated to include 5,000 unique students who have each completed between 211-421 problems in ASSISTments. The dataset includes 1.7 million instances of students solving problems, complete with the answer text, problem text, distractor text, and more.

# Interactions File
Interactions consists of 1,722,169 unique instances of students solving problems. The information provided includes a) problem_id, linking to Problems b) hint_count, the number of hints the student requested c) answer_text, the exact text of their first answer d) saw_answer, a boolean indicating whether the student requested to see the correct answer e) discrete_score, 0 the students score f) end_time, the time at which the student put in the correct answer to the problem g) user_xid, a unique identifier for each student.

Note that ASSISTments provides a discrete_score of 1 only if the student gets the problem correct on their first attempt, without requesting any support. If the student requests a hint, requests the answer, or has multiple tries they receive a 0. Accordingly, a student's answer can be the correct answer, but they can receive a 0 if the student requests a hint or sees the answer before entering the answer. This is shown in “table 7 cognitive accuracy when answers are incorrect” in our paper.

# Problems File
This file consists of information about 3,395 unique problems. The columns include 
1. Problem Set Id, which links problems that follow one another 
2. Problem Part, which indicates where in the Problem Set the problem occurs 
3. Problem Type, describing the type of problem 
4. Answer Type, describing the type of answer (see below table or more information) 
5. Problem Body, the problem text with HTML or markup illustrating exactly what the student saw (code to convert to natural language is available on the github) 
6. Fill-in Options 
7. Fill-in Answers 
8. Multiple Choice Options 
9. Multiple Choice Answers 
10. problem_id

Problem Set example: PSB6N4 consists of three problems. The first is problem_id 151389 (as it has ‘Problem Part’ = 1, the second is problem_id 151533, and the third/last is 151647.

# Skills File
The skills file consists of 
1) problem_id, linking to problems in the Problems file 
2) skill_id, a unique identifier per skill 
3) node_code, which identifies the ASSISTments Skill tag Illustrative Math code for the skill and 
4) node_name, a description of the skill. In total there are 224 unique skills.

# Data Source
All data across each file are from [ASSISTments](https://new.assistments.org/), where students complete in-class work as well as homework and receive support and feedback from the platform. This work was done in conjunction with [Dr. Heffernan’s lab at WPI](https://www.neilheffernan.net/home). To ensure student privacy, our team attempted to remove all Personal Identifiable Information (PII). However, it is possible students could type PII into fill-in problems, which we aimed to detect and remove, but short of a manual review of 1.7 million interaction logs becomes infeasible. Accordingly, we ask that if people using this dataset come across PII to please contact us at [etrials@assistments.org](etrials@assistments.org) so it can be removed.

### FAQs
Q: Where is the code that cleans the problem text?
A: This repository, in Code/clean_utils.py or cleantext.py, both are similar.

Q: How does discrete_score work?
A: Discrete score is 1 if the student solved the problem on their first try without requesting a hint (hint_count) or an explanation/seeing the answer (saw_answer).
Note this is recorded by ASSISTments. There are 433 rows where discrete_score = 1 despite saw_answer = True or hint_count > 0. In these instances, the student correctly solved the problem then requested hints/explanation/the answer anyways.

Q: Does the dataset track multiple attempts? (E.g. the student first incorrectly said 3, then incorrectly answered 6, then correctly answered 9)
A: No. We recognize it may be valuable to have this data. However, currently, answer_text (in Interactions.csv) is the first answer (right or wrong) the student submitted for the problem. Second/future attempts are not included in this dataset, but stay tuned.

Q: I ran <b>python gptoss120bvllmmcq.py --batch-size 10 --num-students 500 --bin-size 10 --min-history 50 --data-dir ../Data --num-gpus 4</b>(or a similar) line and got a different number of predictions. Why?
A: Between running the code and publishing the data we slighlty modified our PII filter. As such, this line: 
selected_users = np.random.choice(all_users, size=min(num_students, len(all_users)), replace=False)
Had a slightly different order, which screwed everything up. If you'd like to run code using the exact same users, please modify your code to get the unique user_ids from Results/inference_data_kt_results.zip, and make selected_users be those unique user_ids. However, note that you may also find more rows (since our prior PII filter was overly strict, and we relaxed it) (~31k if you use the same script). We are working on updating the numbers and will post them here using the extra rows.
